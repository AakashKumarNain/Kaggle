# Kaggle Survey 2018

In 2018, Kaggle hosted its first `Machine Learning and Data Science Annual Survey Challenge` where the participants were asked to
find interesting insights from the survey. Almost `24,000` people all over the world participated in the survey.

### The challenge objective: 
Tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a 
combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. 
The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and 
machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in 
Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs).
This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about! 

### What's there for you in the notebook?
It took me almost 15 days to complete this notebook. If you really want to learn how to use `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, 
`plotly` in an efficient way including advanced usages of all of the above, then this notebook is for you. 
Every part of the survey has been covered in the notebook with as much details as possible. 

### Fun fact
There are more than 2400 lines of code in this notebook but **only two print statements** have been used in the entire notebook.
Everything is accompanied with `visualizations`
